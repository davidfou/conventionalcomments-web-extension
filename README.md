1. Copy `config/template_local.js` to `config/local.js` and replace all values
1. Activate the 2FA authentication

### Update the screenshots for visual regression tests

Unfortunately, the screenshots made locally are not the same as the ones made in the CI. It's possible to retrieve them from GitHub Actions when the visual tests failed. Running the command `yarn update-screenshots` allows to download the screenshots from a specific run. Then, push it and the tests should pass.

### Build the extension

1. Run `yarn build`
1. Check folder `web-ext-artifacts`
